**A very cool yolo v3 algorithm implementation from @heartkilla**

TensorFlow version: 1.13.1

OpenCV version: 4.4.0

Python version: 3.7.4

Download the weights yolov3.weights pre-trained on COCO dataset

Run load_weights.py to generate the weight file in TensorFlow format

Run detect.py to do the detection

Refer to https://github.com/heartkilla/yolo-v3 for more information on implementation

**Tested using my own video taken at the bus stop outside the house as shown below**
